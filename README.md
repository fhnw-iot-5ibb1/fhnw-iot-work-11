### a) Hello World Alexa skill, 15'
* Build and deploy the [Hello World Alexa skill tutorial](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-hello-world/blob/master/instructions/setup-vui-alexa-hosted.md).
* Try using [Echosim.io](https://echosim.io/) to simulate an [Echo](https://www.amazon.com/echo) device.
* [Read the docs](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/create-intents-utterances-and-slots.html) on intents, utterances and slots.
* How would you integrate a product backend?
* Deploying requires an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/).

### b) Voice interaction design, 10'
* Imagine a simple voice controlled connected device.
* Find three use-cases and the corresponding _intents_.
* Write down two realistic _utterances_ for each intent.

### c) Use cases in context, 10'
* Come up with a use case for a _home_, _hotel_ & _hospital_.
* What changes with the context, what stays the same?
* Who is the user? What does the system (not) know?
* Who can see the data? How private is the data?
